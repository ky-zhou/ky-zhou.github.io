I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA, in 2021. I was a postdoc researcher at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China from 2022 to 2024. I am currently working in startup companies Chengdu Minto Tech and WesPark.
